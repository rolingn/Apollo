## Creating the sleapyApolloDino environment (main pipeline lives here):

## First install option:
conda env create -f sleapyApolloDino_environment.yml


## Second option:

conda create -n sleapyApolloDino python == 3.12.4


# Activate the environment after creating it:
conda activate sleapyApolloDino


# Navigate to the environment folder with:
# Mac:
cd $CONDA_PREFIX
# Windows:
cd %CONDA_PREFIX%


# Find this folder and move the contents of the sleapyApolloDino_setup folder to the sleapyApolloDino environment folder. Printing the following in the terminal might help finding the sleapyApolloDino environment folder:
# Mac:
echo $CONDA_PREFIX
# Windows:
echo %CONDA_PREFIX%


# Install the requirements:
conda install pip
pip install -r requirements.txt


# The setup should be complete. You can close the terminal. Additional 'pip install' calls might be necessary if packages are missing.
